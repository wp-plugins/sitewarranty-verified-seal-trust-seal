== Description ==

Proving your website and business can be trusted is essential to covert sales from new customers who haven't used your product or services before. The SiteWarranty trust seal increases sales by visually displaying proof that your company address, phone number and order processing has been authenticated by a third party company and is up to date.

This type of authentication can increase sales by up to 40% and dramatically increase site visit times.
