== Description ==

Get notified by Email or SMS the instant your WordPress website goes down or develops a fault.

Reliable uptime is an integral part of owning a website. Whilst many hosting companies will claim their service uptime is always above 99%, how do you know? Without physically checking your site every minute of each day, you just can’t be sure your site is online. 

When downtime does occur, how long would it take you to notice? Downtime could happen when you’re asleep, on holiday or in a business meeting for example, and it's likely you’ll never know. As we all know, downtime is costly. Downtime loses sales & repeat custom, damages your reputation, affects SEO and search engine rankings, to name only a few of the disadvantages.

Thankfully there is a solution.  Sitestillup is a site uptime monitoring service. If your site has a problem, you or your web master will be notified instantly by email or SMS*. So you’ll be able to sleep at night, relax by the pool on holiday and even report in your business meeting how Sitestillup has increased your sales, site visits and google rankings.

Included with Sitestillup is our increasingly popular SiteWarranty seal, a third party business verification seal and virus checker. Displaying a SiteWarranty trust seal on your website reassures first time visitors to your site, by verifying your business details.

FREE? – As you may have seen from our advertising and marketing, Sitestillup is free.  Our free package is for one website with 60 minute interval checks and we’ve even included our SiteWarranty seal with email verification.

Why Upgrade? – Sitestillup’s interval check can be increased so your site is checked every minute, reducing any potential downtime further. When you upgrade to any package, we’ll also upgrade your SiteWarranty seal to verify your businesses phone number and address. And if that wasn’t enough, we even throw in a daily virus scan of your website. 

*SMS messages require the purchase of a SMS pack.
