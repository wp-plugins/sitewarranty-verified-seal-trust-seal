== Description ==

Proving your website and business can be trusted is essential to covert sales from new customers who haven't used your product or services before. The SiteWarranty trust seal/site seal increases sales by visually displaying proof that your company address, phone number and order processing has been authenticated by a third party company and is up to date.
This type of authentication can increase sales by up to 40% and dramatically increase site visit times.

During the initial verification process we will run various identity checks to confirm your company's details, where we will contact you on the details provided during sign up. On signup, you will be asked to complete a verification check, which requires a 1p transaction to be made with a bank account that is in the name of either the company or the owner of the company.

Verification can take between 24 â€“ 48 hours and successful applicants will be emailed automatically.
